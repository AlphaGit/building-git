# What YOU can expect from this tutorial

* YOU can expect a simple to follow tutorial starting from very basic concepts
* YOU can expect a tutorial that covers all of git aspects
* YOU can expect a guide that's extensive, but that you can check in pieces and can use as reference
* YOU can expect a light hearted approach to it all and  to have a few laughs

Wow, it's all you, you, you. Stop it already.

We're going to start with the basic concepts of VCSs and progressively working our ways towards the absolute best approach that we can, ending up with what git actually is.

Note that while the tutorial is named "building git", we're not actually going to be building it, at least not literally. (It feels SO dumb to use this title while I'm drafting this and already making excuses.) We're going to figuratively build our way towards what a VCS should do and once it makes sense, git is going to make that dream a reality.
