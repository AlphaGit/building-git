# What you should NOT expect from this tutorial

**This is not a list of best practices on git.** This is going to simplify its use cases, and even touch on the advanced features, but this is not a comprehensive approach into how to use git for teams or even solo. Different things work for different people and different approaches have different pro-s and con-s. While I'd love to get into them, because I'm as opinionated as someone can be, this is not the place to do it.

**This is not a description of git's internal mechanisms.** git _is_ freaking complicated on the inside. Performance, conflict resolution strategies, cryptography, dark magic... everything here makes for the amazingly complex product that git is. We're going to approach it from a user's point of view, not from a  git-internals developer's point of view.

**This is not a guide to using a particular git GUI.** IMO, they assume too much, and they widely differ. This guide is going to base itself on the console usage of git. Once you understand what the console does, all GUIs should be very simple to understand.
