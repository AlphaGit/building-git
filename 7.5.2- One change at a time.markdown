### One change at a time

Imagine that you're making several changes to your document, your code, your sweater knitting, or whatever it is you're doing. It is always simpler and less error prone to make your changes one at a time, evaluate how everything is going and continue with the next change.

In each of these checkpoints and evaluations, if you happen to find that something's wrong, you don't need to backtrace everything that you've done so far to find out where you messed up, but rather just from the last checkpoint. This means less wasted hours, less headaches, and a more predictable time usage.

Making one change at a time is pretty much what any organized person would do, and making these checkpoints come up naturally when you realize that whatever you've done so far can be considered one "change" in on itself.

Now, if there was a way to formalize these checkpoints... maybe _committing_ to what you have done so far...
