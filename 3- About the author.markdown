# About the author

Since we're on the subject of what I'd do, let me introduce myself.

My name is Juan Diego Raimondi, called "JD" by everyone, and I work for a company called MakingSense as a solutions architect. I help support clients and internal or external projects, doing a variety of things to make sure we create things that _make sense_.

In case you wondered, yes, the company name itself is a bad pun but we're that bold and we can afford to do it.

MakingSense has both products of their own and works with clients in different industries.

I'm usually doing this stuff on my spare time, but if you do like them and want more of my time into it, [contact us](http://makingsense.com/talk-to-us) and tell us "I want JD to do more open source stuff!".

Now, if you want to contact me, personally, you can do so at [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/AlphaTwi).

Enough about me. Let's talk about you.
