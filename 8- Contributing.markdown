# Contributing

I don't intend this tutorial to be very seriously taken, but I do intend it to be accurate. If you do find out inconsistencies, errors, or you want to suggest improvements, please do so. This full tutorial, its texts and videos are going to be available as a GitHub repository.

If you do want to contribute, there are several ways in which you can reach be (Twitter, Email, Facebook, LinkedIn, ...), but I suggest that the best approach would be to actually visit the repository and [open a ticket](https://github.com/AlphaGit/building-git/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/AlphaGit/building-git/pulls).
