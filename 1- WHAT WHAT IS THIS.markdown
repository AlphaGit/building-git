# WHAT? WHAT IS THIS?

Woah, woah, calm down.

Welcome to "Building git: a git tutorial"! This is a series of files and hopefully videos that you can use to get introduced to git. Since git is a topic that is strange to some, and challenging to others, I think this set of articles or videos will help out in bringing them down to Earth.

The whole approach to this tutorial, guide, book, videoblog, or whatever it becomes, is meant to be "graspable". If you spot errors, or think of improvements, check the "Contributing" section.
