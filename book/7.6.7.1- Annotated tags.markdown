### Annotated tags

As you know by know, a tag is pretty much tag: a particular note, an indicator, _something_ on that particular commit. For some operations, you will need something more reliable, something that actually has special information about the state of the repository at that point.

Come into scene: _annotated tags_.

For example, GitHub uses annotated tags to differentiate releases in a particular repository.

Annotated tags have everything that a regular tag has, plus:

- checksum of the contents
- tag author name, email
- tag date
- message
- signature verifiable with GPG

So you can see why for particular purposes you'd prefer an annotated tag.

Creating one is as simple as it gets:

```console
git tag -a v0.1 -m "First test version"
```
