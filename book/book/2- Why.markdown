# Why?

You and me have probably seen several git tutorials on the internet. And you may agree with me that they jump too quickly into the advanced stuff, and that look too complicated on their own.

If they don't, it's very likely that they don't present the whole set of features that git has. And this sucks, because git is a wonderful tool, a swiss-army knife of development, and just using it to open your beer is cool, but not cool enough.

This tutorial pretends to be an easy-to-follow, progressive, light-hearted approach to git that is comprehensible to every level of developers. It'll start with the basic concepts and later on jump to the real-deal of git usage.
