## Initializing a repository

If we jump into any directory, we can ask git to initialize it like this:

```console
> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/alpha/building-git/.git/
```

As you see, git will tell us that it has initialized that repository, and that the folder is now considered a git repository. As well, you can see that it created a `.git` directory in it. This is what it will use to store it's inner workings, tracking devices and everything else to take care of this folder for you. This means that it will not mess up your directory existing files at all.

Similarly, if you want to specify a particular folder to be initialized, you can specify it:

```console
> git init my-repo
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/alpha/buiding-git/my-repo/.git/
```

Congratulations! You already have created your first repository and are ready to start tracking changes in it.
