### Going back and forth

Oops! You messed up. And you've been messing up for a while, since you did your checkpoints. You did our evaluations, but still something was wrong from the very start. I could have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids and your dog...

[image of circles, one after the other, connected with lines, some of those at the left are filled up in green, some others only have the green border. The last filled circle has an arrow to it saying "last good checkpoint"]

Now, not everything is lost. Our best approach at the moment is to go back as many checkpoints until we are in a way that was still correct. This will allow us to restart from that point without throwing away what has been done since then.

What we need to do now it so _check-out_ how the situation was at that point in time, and go from there.

[same as last image of circles, but with a new set of changes branching from the last good known change, with more filling circles]
